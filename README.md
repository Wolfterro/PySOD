# PySOD
## The classic Screen Of Death, now in Python!

### Description:

##### This is a simple "Jokeware" program that I've made out of boredom, it's a little Pygame program that fullscreen's an image (.png format) and plays an audio file (.wav format) to prank you or your friends and family.
##### You can put new image files in the "Screens" directory, it is recommended a Full HD (1920x1080) image saved in the .png format.
##### You can put new sound files in the "Sounds" directory, it must be an audio file in .wav format!
##### You can exit the program by pressing ESC, Space or Return key.
